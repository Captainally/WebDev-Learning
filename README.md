## 100xDevs-Cohort-Assignments Repository


Welcome to my 100xDevs-Cohort-Assignments repository!

This repository is a collection of all the projects and assignments I will be working on throughout the cohort. Each project and assignment is meticulously organized and documented here to track my progress and highlight my work.


Purpose
The main objective of this repository is to chronicle my learning journey and display the work I complete during the cohort. It serves as a comprehensive record of my projects and assignments.
